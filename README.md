# Book Search Engine

## Description:
This application was created in the USYD Coding Bootcamp and refactors a Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The search engine is built using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. A user can create an account, search for books, and save them to a list. On a separately rendered page, the user can see their saved books and remove books from the list.

## Installation

- Download it through Github
- Run npm i in terminal to install packages


## Live URL

The web application is deployed to Render. Link to deployed website: [Book Search Engine](https://book-search-engine-gkd2.onrender.com/)
